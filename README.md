# SPPFY Calendar

A web application for [SPPFY](https://www.sppfy.com/) to manage scheduling. The calendar can handle customer bookings, holidays, staff off-days, and customer pickups. The app comes with both a calendar view for planning day-to-day operations, and a list view for ease of sifting through data.

Bookings from separate shopfronts are also aggregated and can be merged into the calendar.

## Usage

The app is hosted online at https://shy-gray-piranha-belt.cyclic.app/.

Users can register and login to view limited information on the calendar. Only users with additional access can view and edit full records.

## User Stories

As a business owner of a terrarium workshop, I want an app to help track customer bookings. I also want to combine the bookings from my multiple storefronts into a single calendar.
